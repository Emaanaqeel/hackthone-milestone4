Milestone 4: Editable Resume

Objective: Make the resume editable after it has been generated.
Action Steps:

● Edit Functionality: Implement a feature that allows users to click on specific
sections of the resume (e.g., Education or Work Experience) and edit the content
directly. This feature will make the resume more interactive and user-friendly.

● Real-Time Updates: Ensure that the changes users make are reflected
immediately on the screen without needing to refresh the page. This will require
JavaScript or TypeScript to handle real-time DOM manipulation.

● GitHub and Deployment: Update the code on GitHub to include the edit
functionality. Redeploy the updated project on Vercel so that others can see and
test the new features.
